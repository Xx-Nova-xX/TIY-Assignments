* [ ]Let's have a mocha...!

* [ ] Install mocha via npm
* [ ] Pair up for at least 2 hours:
*  Commit incrementally using your Github names as a prefix to your commit message
 * Ensure both pairs have code before you finish
  * [ ] Rewrite your Coding Dojo examples using the mocha helpers:
* [ ] BDD: describe(), it(), etc
* [ ] TDD: suite(), test(), etc
* [ ] Run your tests while you refactor; don't wait until you're "done"!
Don't you think that you should have a branch? Maybe a PR would be nice?
Feel like a chai...?

* [ ] Install chai via npm 
  * [ ] Pair up for at least 2 hours with someone else: do that @mention commit thingy
* [ ] Refactor your rewritten katas to use chai instead of the built-in assert module
* [ ] Attempt one or more tests in a different style:
Good ole assert
I expect that you will...
You should really behave...
What about that branching thing? You've heard of Pull Requests?
Playing with new ideas...

* [ ] Read through the MDN documentation on JavaScript Array Methods
  * [ ] Translate each one using English and maybe some examples.
    * [ ] Retype the multidimensional array example
* [ ] Write a series of steps that adjust the array to look like the Catalan Opening: Closed Variation
* [ ] Write tests that verify that your "board" looks correctly at every step.
* [ ] Rewrite your katas using your new skills:
*"Check Writing" should implement a toEnglish() function that translates Number to String in a single step
*"String Calculator" should implement a fromEnglish() function that translates String to Number in a single step
*"Conway's Game of Life" should utilize only Array methods.
* [ ] Tackle at least two Project Euler problems from the 1 - 10 series; avoid prime number problems. :D
