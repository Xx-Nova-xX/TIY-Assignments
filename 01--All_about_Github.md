My family enjoys scuba-diving so nearly every school vacation we go on a diving trip. We have noticed that there are three completely different kinds of divers. We call them the "nature lovers", the "pool guys", and the "seals". The people that we call "nature lovers" enjoy getting in the water for a short swim to look at the rocks, seaweed, and underwater creatures which are swimming around. The "pool guys", who wear the latest hi-tech equipment, come for a short while to have a swim and test how good their equipments are. The "seals", who wear only their swimsuits, dive into the water and disappear for what seems like hours. Each of these divers enjoy the ocean in a different way.

    The "nature lovers" are the ones that enjoy snorkeling around for brief periods of time. They always try to have a minimal impact on the environment. For example, their trash or garbage, is always taken out. Taking rocks and shells is something that they would never do. They are there to see but not to spoil the beauty of nature that is underwater.

    The "pool guys" are the divers that want to go to the beach or ocean without ever actually leaving their backyard. They come in utility vehicles (SUVs) carrying heavy-duty wet suits with the latest in diving masks, fins, and air tanks. The pool guys are also the ones that are so covered with equipment that they can hardly see, feel, or touch the underwater environment. Comparing air tanks and wet suits are what they enjoy doing most.

    The "seals" are the divers that act as if they are returning back to their natural habitat. Perhaps in a previous life they were actually seals. When diving into the water they hardly make a splash. As soon as they are in the water they start poking around looking for crabs, abalone, and other fish. The "seals" are the people who cook on the beach. They are also the ones that leave the biggest mess. However, since they use beach wood for their fires and eat what they catch in the ocean there is no paper or plastic packaging left behind.

    My family are a combination of all three types. All my brother wants to do are try out different kinds of equipment and see how deep he can dive. As for my father, he is a "seal": swimming around and cooking his 'catch' are what he enjoy most. My mother and I are "nature lovers": swimming with snorkels and fins is fun, but neither of us have any interest in diving fifty feet down or reaching under a rock to find a slimy abalone. So, we all enjoy our diving trips in our own way.
