Anyway, I figure with a handle like that my guy's gotta be some sort of a, some sort of an of egg head. No offense. And here we go, Gale 'Major Tom' Boetticher. Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking. Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right? That's pretty rare these days, but it does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking.

		   	  	Yes, I do, I have... concerns. If we're going to go down this road and clearly we are for the sake of my brother-in-law. At any rate, I need some assurances that we're going to go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious. You know, I'm a bookkeeper so I know what money laundering is. And uh... as with most things, the devil is in the details. So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?
