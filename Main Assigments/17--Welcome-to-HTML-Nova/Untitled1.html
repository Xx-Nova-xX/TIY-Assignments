+<h1>I am <span class='Batman'>Batman</span></h1>
+
+ <p>It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
+
+ I take what I need from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of the people with less.
+
+ This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.
+
+ You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.
+
+ I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.
+
+ Once you've done what you had to, they never let you do what you want to.
+
+ You don't owe these people anymore. You've given them everything.
+
+ <span>Now choice is yours: exile or death?</span>
+
+ <span id='pain'>It will be extremely painful... for you</span>
+
+ But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.
+
+ Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.
+
+ To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?
+
+ Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.
+
+ You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.
+
+ It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
+
+ Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.
+
+ I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
+
+ That's a lovely lovely voice!

+<h1>Say 'what' again, I dare you</h1>
+
+<p>
+I can do that.
+Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
+
+Hold on to your butts.
+You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
+
+No, motherfucker.
+My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
+
+Hold on to your butts.
+Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
+
+Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!
+Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
